<h2>ðŸ› How It Works</h2>

1. User logs in on localhost:5000/ through login.html.
2. If credentials are correct, the session is created.
3. The user is redirected to localhost:5000/redirect, where they see a countdown for 5 seconds before being taken to localhost:5000/profile.
4. The profile page welcomes the user and provides a logout option.
